# project aim
pdf comprehension backend to build personal bureauccatic database

# theory

## principles and mechanics

- finetuning data set creation can be automatized
- starting point is always a simple pipeline - indeed the flow of information is fundamental project topology
- the bridge to the users is vital - feedback, chat option
- a simple pipeline can be achieved with digital invoices and already exist
- the document layout - structuring the content - is difficult, ie. a meta-task
- overall, the project needs to incorporate different temporal paths, ie. obsolete models/tunes/databases need to be connected even when they are not in use (as inference marks the moment of existence)

## software parts
- database system
- content retrieval system


for the tool to be applicable in regards to privacy
- it can either run locally
- or encryption is vital

need some good hosting plan and interaction with local database
### database system

- can be first a secure database with essential bureaucratic information, which ties to hardware
- has a meta-knowledge obligation, ie. feedback of content and categorization
- llm hybrid-query and rag accessing
- different parallel categorical systems (better then nested?, both limited)
- embedding models are also part of the database system

### content retrieval system

- there is multi-modality, but the focus is on text-llm for now
- structured content requires structured reading
- ocr - extract words and positions from document
- there is ocr and ocr-free donut
- there is a finetuning pipeline

# practice

- proof of concept of text extraction from scanned documents
- german language, needs a translation pipeline
- first steps are testing out the different versions of [layoutlm](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/blob/master/layoutlmv3/README.md) and [donut](https://github.com/clovaai/donut) on a couple of test documents
